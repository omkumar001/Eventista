# Eventista
It is a platform which connects the attendee as well as the organizer and ensures the successful execution of an event .

# Why this Project :

In today’s world where everything is going online with the growing technology . Lack of time has been the biggest issue of almost all the people in the whole world as the people nowadays have become busy and lazy too . 

# About :
So to overcome these problems , Eventista provides a platform where people can easily host and participate in events at their own comfort zone . This website will be super helpful in saving time and the users will have a wide range of events available to them . In addition to this , one can also see the details of the organizer of a particular event and if they like the organizers work , they can connect them through various social media platforms as it would be provided in organizer's profile. Users can also book tickets for an event at their own convenience and with a singe click. And if any changes are being made to the details of the events , it will be easily reflected back to both the website and the attende’s side. 

In order to complete this project we will be using the MySQL database which will be connected to the website which is being built using the front-end tools.
